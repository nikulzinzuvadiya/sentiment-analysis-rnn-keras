# sentiment-analysis-rnn-keras

This repository demonstrates sentiment analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in Keras. It includes two parts:

Custom Text Processing:

Tokenization, sequence generation, and padding on a small custom dataset of Indian-themed phrases.
Embedding layer for word vector representations.
IMDB Dataset:

Sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset using an RNN architecture with an embedding layer and a SimpleRNN layer.
Preprocessing includes padding and truncation to standardize input lengths.
The model is trained and evaluated for binary classification (positive/negative sentiment).
Ideal for beginners exploring sentiment analysis and RNNs. Includes examples of text tokenization, sequence padding, and model evaluation.
